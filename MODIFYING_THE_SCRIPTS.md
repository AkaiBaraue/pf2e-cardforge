## Modifying the Scripts (Optional)

The Nandeck scripts in this repo can be modified as you see fit. Know that you will need a decent understanding of how Nandeck functions to not break things (if you do break something, simply re-download the scripts from this repo).

If you just want to experiment with new layouts, I recommend creating a copy of `PF2e_Positioning_Front.txt` and `PF2e_Visual_Front_Common.txt`, then modifying the copies however you want. Remember to update line 31-32 in `PF2e Generate Cards For Sheet.txt` to point to your new scripts instead.
